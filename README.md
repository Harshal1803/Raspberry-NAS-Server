# Raspberry-NAS-Server
Made a fully fledged NAS Server using Raspberry Pi Model 4B, used samba and ntfs-3g for the setup, and works on pi OS.
Currently using third party software for managing the storage from android.
Also, trying to build a web application for managing the access, server connection, and storage management, basically a google drive(but mine)
