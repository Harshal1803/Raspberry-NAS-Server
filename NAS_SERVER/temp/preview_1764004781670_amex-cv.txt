Hiring Manager
American Express

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Site Reliability Engineering role at American Express. With hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, observability, automation, and container orchestration, I am eager to contribute to Amex’s 175-year tradition of innovation by building resilient, scalable, and high-performing systems that directly support your customers and business objectives.

In my recent internships at Mathionix Technologies and HitoriTech, I gained practical experience in designing and implementing reliable systems:

Deployed and managed scalable AWS EC2 infrastructure with load balancing and auto-scaling for high-traffic applications.

Built and optimized CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, achieving zero-downtime deployments and reducing release times by 40%.

Monitored and optimized infrastructure with Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch, ensuring performance visibility and proactive incident response.

Managed Docker- and Kubernetes-based environments, enabling seamless scaling and high availability of containerized applications.

Technically, I bring proficiency in Python, Bash, and Linux system administration, with strong foundations in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), and a deep interest in observability and SRE practices. I have also designed automation workflows with Terraform and Ansible, complementing infrastructure-as-code initiatives.

What excites me most about American Express is your commitment to resilience and innovation—from chaos engineering practices to disaster recovery strategies. I am motivated by the challenge of contributing to systems where reliability, scalability, and performance directly impact millions of customers worldwide.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with American Express’s mission to define the future of secure and reliable financial services.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Team Amex.

Sincerely,
Harshal Verma
